## How to install and Run tests with cypress

To install Cypress move inside your project folder and run:

```sh
npm i cypress --save-dev
```

Give it some seconds and you’re ready to go.

Before moving on scaffold Cypress’s directories with

```sh
node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

Cypress will create its own directories under

```sh
./cypress
```

To start Cypress run:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

Cypress will launch its own UI and then you’ll see the browser going through every step, as listed in your spec file.
